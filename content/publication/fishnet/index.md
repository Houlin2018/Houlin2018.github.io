abstract: The simulations show that, as the number of links becomes larger, the likelihood of having more than three failed links up to the peak load is no longer negligible and becomes large for fishnets with many thousands of links. A differential equation is derived for the probability distribution of not-too-large fishnets, characterized by the size effect, the mean and the coefficient of variation.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations and advanced statistical methods, I developed a novel framework for analyzing failure risks in complex structural systems. By studying fishnet models with over a million simulation trials, I uncovered how failure mechanisms transition from discrete to continuum scales.
