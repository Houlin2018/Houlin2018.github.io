      title: '📚 My Research'
      subtitle: ''

        My research lies at the intersection of computational mechanics, machine learning, and sustainable engineering. I developed the Smooth Crack Band Model (sCBM), which achieved a 110x speed improvement through novel coupling on high-performance computing platforms. This innovation enables real-time simulations of coupled physical phenomena, significantly advancing our understanding of fracture mechanics.
        I am currently involved in several exciting research initiatives:
        - Developing innovative computational models for hydraulic fracturing and CO₂ sequestration in geo-materials
        - Advancing probabilistic analysis frameworks for extreme failure risk assessment
        - Integrating machine learning techniques with traditional constitutive models for enhanced material behavior prediction
        
        Please reach out to collaborate! 😃
